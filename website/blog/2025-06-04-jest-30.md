Jest 30 has arrived as a major update to the popular JavaScript testing framework. This release brings numerous improvements, new features, and some clean-up of deprecated APIs. In this post, we’ll summarize the key changes in Jest 30. Let’s dive in!

## Node.js and TypeScript Support Updates

### Minimum Node.js version is now v18.14.0

It drops support for Node 14, 16, 19, 21, and 23, making Node **18.x** the minimum supported version. This aligns Jest with current LTS Node releases and ensures better compatibility with modern JavaScript features. If you’re upgrading from older Node versions, be sure to update Node before using Jest 30.

### Minimum TypeScript version is now v5.4

The minimum TypeScript version for Jest’s type definitions is now 5.4. This means you should upgrade your TypeScript compiler if you rely on Jest’s types (e.g. in a TypeScript test suite or if you import `@jest/globals`). Using the latest TypeScript ensures you benefit from improved typings that come with Jest 30.

### JSDOM updated from v20 to v26

The `jest-environment-jsdom` package in Jest 30 uses a newer JSDOM release (v26). In practice, this means the simulated browser environment might behave slightly closer to real browsers, but it could also introduce subtle changes in DOM APIs or new warnings. For most tests this won’t require changes, but if you have very DOM-specific assertions and notice differences, you may want to check the JSDOM release notes for changes between versions. Overall, keeping JSDOM up-to-date helps Jest better emulate modern browser behaviors in tests.

### Using custom JSDOM versions

Jest 30 introduces `jest-environment-jsdom-abstract`, a new environment package that allows you to plug in a custom JSDOM version. This is mainly for advanced scenarios, but it means if you need a specific JSDOM (beyond the default) for certain tests, you now have a supported way to swap it in.

## Enhanced ECMAScript Module (ESM) and File Extension Support

Jest 30 expands its support for ECMAScript Modules and TypeScript files, making configuration easier for projects using these modern module formats. **Out-of-the-box support for additional file extensions** is a major improvement. The default Jest configuration now treats `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.mts`, and `.cts` files as first-class citizens for modules and test files. In previous versions, you might have needed custom configuration to include TypeScript ESM files (like `.mts`) or CommonJS TypeScript files (`.cts`). Now, Jest 30 includes `.mts` and `.cts` in its default `moduleFileExtensions`, and the default `testMatch`/`testRegex` patterns have been updated to recognize `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.mts`, and `.cts` test files. This means if your project uses these extensions, Jest will find and run those tests by default (and you can remove any workarounds you previously had in your config).

**TypeScript configuration files are better supported** in this release as well. Jest 30 can load TypeScript config files (for example, a `jest.config.ts` or `.cts` file) without extra setup, thanks to an integrated docblock-based loader. In practice, this makes it easier to keep your Jest configuration in TypeScript – Jest will handle transpiling the config internally using `esbuild` in most cases. This improvement removes the need for manual steps or custom scripts to register TS transpilation for the config file. In addition, if Node is already strips TypeScript types (allowing it to run `.ts` files natively), Jest will detect that and skip using its own TypeScript loader.

ESM support isn’t just about file extensions. **Under the hood, Jest’s packages now provide proper ESM exports** and have been restructured for better ESM compatibility. All of Jest’s internal modules are bundled into a few files for faster startup, and each official package defines an export map for Node’s ESM resolver. For the average user, this change is invisible – you continue to use Jest the same way – but it generally improves performance by reducing the file I/O overhead on startup. (One side effect: if you were importing internal, unofficial modules from Jest’s code, those imports will break due to the repackaging – but doing that was never supported, so it won’t affect normal usage.)

On a related note, **Jest 30’s module resolution got smarter for Node ESM features**. You can now use `import.meta` properties in your tests and modules when running under Jest. Specifically, Jest 30 supports `import.meta.url`, `import.meta.filename`, `import.meta.dirname`, and even the new `import.meta.resolve` for module resolution. If you have tests or library code that rely on these ESM-specific globals (for example, determining the current file path via `import.meta.url`), Jest will no longer choke on them – it handles these as Node does (note that some of these features require Node 20+). Additionally, Jest’s resolver now understands `file://` URL imports, which can appear in ESM contexts. Jest now also respects Node’s conditional exports when resolving stub modules (like manual mocks), passing along the `conditions` option. This ensures even stubbed modules pick the correct export variant for the current environment. All of this means Jest 30 plays more nicely with modern ESM projects.

## New Testing APIs and Features

This release isn’t only about behind-the-scenes changes – it also introduces some handy new features for writing and running tests.

### Configurable test retries

Jest has long supported `jest.retryTimes()` to automatically retry failing tests a set number of times, which is useful for flaky tests. In Jest 30, this API got more flexible with new options to control retry behavior. You can now specify a delay between retries or choose to retry immediately. For example, you might want to wait a brief period before retrying to let external resources settle:

```js
// Retry failed tests up to 3 times, waiting 1 second between attempts
jest.retryTimes(3, {waitBeforeRetry: 1000});
```

Alternatively, if you want to retry a failed test immediately after it fails instead of waiting for the entire test suite to finish, you can set the `retryImmediately` option:

```js
jest.retryTimes(3, {retryImmediately: true});
```

[Documentation](/docs/jest-object#jestretrytimesnumretries-options)

### Asynchronous setup support

Another quality-of-life improvement: files listed in `setupFilesAfterEnv` can now export an async function. In Jest 29 and earlier, any global setup you did in those files had to run synchronously at startup. With Jest 30, if your setup file exports an async function, Jest will `await` it before running tests. This is great for cases where you need to, say, establish a database connection, seed data, or perform some asynchronous initialization once per test suite. You no longer need to hack around this with manual `beforeAll` in every test file – your global setup can handle async work directly.

### Improved timers and scheduling

For those testing time-based code. Jest’s fake timers have been upgraded under the hood. Notably, Jest 30 includes the latest version of [`@sinonjs/fake-timers`](https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers) (v13), and it exposes a new function `jest.advanceTimersToNextFrame()`. This function advances all pending `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks to the next frame boundary. In practice, if you’re testing code that uses `requestAnimationFrame`, you can use `jest.advanceTimersToNextFrame()` to simulate moving forward one frame, causing all scheduled animation callbacks to run. This complements the existing timer APIs and makes it easier to test animations or any code scheduling work with `requestAnimationFrame`. (No more manually guessing millisecond durations for `advanceTimersByTime` to trigger an animation frame callback – one call to advance to the next frame does it.)

[Documentation](/docs/jest-object#jestadvancetimerstonextframe)

### Enhanced parameterized tests

#### New placeholder `%$`

If you use data-driven tests with `test.each`, Jest 30 brings some nice enhancements. You can now include a special placeholder `%$` in your test titles to inject the **number of the test case** (helpful for identifying individual cases in the output). For example:

```javascript
test.each(cases)('Case %$ works as expected', () => {});
```

will replace `%$` with the test’s sequence number. (The existing `%#` placeholder continues to represent the zero-based index; `%$` is the 1-based count.)

[Documentation](/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout)

#### Better typings

Additionally, TypeScript support for parameterized tests is improved – you can use typed tuples or readonly arrays (e.g. `as const` tables) with `test.each()` and get better type inference for the test parameters.

### New and improved matchers

#### `expect.arrayOf`

Jest 30 introduces a handy new asymmetric matcher, `expect.arrayOf`, which lets you validate every element of an array against a condition or type. For instance, you can expect an array of numbers ensuring all items are numbers:

```javascript
expect(someArray).toEqual(expect.arrayOf(expect.any(Number)));
```

[Documentation](/docs/expect#expectarrayofvalue)

#### Better typings for `.toHaveBeenCalledWith`

The type inference for `.toHaveBeenCalledWith` and related matchers is improved in TypeScript, so it can catch mismatched argument types at compile time. This doesn’t change runtime behavior, but it makes your tests safer and surfaces mistakes early if you’re using TypeScript.

#### Other

There are also minor tweaks like better diff output when an `expect.objectContaining` fails (so you can more easily spot which properties didn’t match), and stricter checks in `toThrow`/`toThrowError` to ensure the thrown error is the expected type – small improvements that polish the developer experience.

### Spies and the `using` keyword

You can use JavaScript’s new explicit resource management syntax (`using`) with Jest spies. If your environment supports it, writing `using jest.spyOn(obj, 'method')` will automatically restore the spy when the block ends, so you don’t have to manually clean up. ()

```typescript
test('logs a warning', () => {
  using spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'warn');
  doSomeThingWarnWorthy();
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

[Documentation](/docs/jest-object#spied-methods-and-the-using-keyword)

### Tidier open handle warnings

When tests leave behind open handles (like unclosed timers or connections), Jest now groups the warnings by their stack trace. If multiple handles originate from the same code path, you'll see one combined warning, making it easier to track down the cause without repetitive logs.

### Test setup performance stats

The test runner now tracks how long the setup phase takes and reports it via `perfStats`. This surfaces how much time global setup or environment initialization adds, helping you spot slow startup phases.

### Module mocking enhancements

#### `jest.unstable_unmockModule()`

Jest 30 adds new experimental `jest.unstable_unmockModule()` API for finer control when unmocking modules (especially in ESM)

[Documentation](/docs/ecmascript-modules#module-unmocking-in-esm)

#### `jest.onGenerateMock(callback)`

Also, a new `onGenerateMock` method was added. It registers a callback function that is invoked whenever Jest generates a mock for a module. This callback allows you to modify the mock before it is returned to the rest of your tests.

```javascript
jest.onGenerateMock((modulePath, moduleMock) => {
  // Inspect the module name and decide how to transform the mock
  if (modulePath.includes('Database')) {
    // For demonstration, let's replace a method with our own custom mock
    moduleMock.connect = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
      console.log('Connected to mock DB');
    });
  }

  // Return the (potentially modified) mock
  return moduleMock;
});
```

[Documentation](/docs/jest-object#jestongeneratemockcb)

## Snapshots and Formatting Improvements

Snapshots – a popular feature in Jest for testing UI and component output – have gotten some attention in Jest 30 to make them more useful and easier to read:

### Error causes in snapshots

JavaScript Errors can have a `cause` property (an Error option introduced in newer JS). Jest 30’s snapshot serializer will now include the `cause` of an Error when you serialize it. This means if your code throws an error that caused another error, the snapshot will show that nested cause, giving you more context. Previously, such information might have been dropped from the snapshot output.

```javascript
expect(
  () => new Error('some error', {cause: new Error('caused by something')}),
).toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot();
```

Before:

```
some error
```

After:

```
some error
Cause: caused by something
```

### Cleaner React component snapshots

If you use Jest to snapshot-test React components, you might be familiar with the occasional `""` (empty string) entries in the output for components that render nothing or empty strings. The React-specific snapshot serializer in Jest 30 no longer prints empty string children. In other words, `<SomeComponent>{""}</SomeComponent>` will be treated as having no children in the snapshot. This cleans up snapshots by removing noise – an empty string is often not semantically important, and omitting it makes the snapshot diffs smaller and more focused on real changes.

Before:

```
<Mouse>

</Mouse>
```

After:

```
<Mouse />
```

### Better object printing

Jest’s pretty-printer (the library that formats objects for expect messages and snapshots) has been improved for certain data types. For instance, `ArrayBuffer` and `DataView` instances will now be printed in a more human-readable form, rather than as opaque objects with internal fields. If you have tests that log or snapshot complex objects including binary data or typed arrays, the output will be easier to understand in Jest 30.

```javascript
expect(new ArrayBuffer(3)).toMatchSnapshot();
```

Before:

```
ArrayBuffer []
```

After:

```
ArrayBuffer [
  0,
  0,
  0,
]
```

### Custom object serialization

Jest’s matcher utilities now support defining a static `SERIALIZABLE_PROPERTIES` on custom objects. This allows you to control which properties of a custom object are included in snapshots and error messages, making the output more focused and relevant.

[Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/next/expect#serializable_properties)

### Prettier 3 support

If your project uses Prettier for code formatting, you’ll be happy to know Jest 30’s snapshot system is compatible with Prettier 3. The snapshot preparser/serializer was updated to support Prettier 3’s formatting changes.

In short, snapshot outputs should be more informative and less noisy in this release, reducing the friction when updating and reviewing snapshots.

## Configuration and CLI Changes

Being a major release, Jest 30 includes some updates to configuration options and command-line interface usage. Here are the notable ones to be aware of:

### `testPathPattern` is now `testPathPatterns`

You’ll need to update your config and any CLI usage. In config files, `testPathPatterns` now expects an array of patterns (instead of a single regex). This actually makes the feature more flexible – you can specify multiple include patterns for test files. Correspondingly, the CLI flag is now `--testPathPatterns` (with an “s”). You can provide multiple patterns separated by spaces or by using the flag multiple times. This change shouldn’t affect you unless you were filtering tests by path, but it’s an easy find-and-replace if so.

### No more `jest --init`

The interactive `jest --init` command (which walked you through creating a config file) has been removed. This command was long deprecated and is now gone in Jest 30. For most users, this isn’t a huge loss – you can initialize a Jest config with alternatives like `npm init jest@latest` (or the Yarn/Pnpm equivalents), which achieve a similar result of scaffolding a configuration. Removing `jest --init` helps reduce maintenance of rarely used code paths.

### Config file path in package.json

You can now specify the Jest config file path right in your package.json. If the `jest` field in package.json is set to a string (pointing to a config file), Jest will load that file as the configuration.

### Stricter CLI flag enforcement

Jest’s CLI will now error out if you forget to pass a value to certain flags that require one. For example, previously you might have run `jest --maxWorkers` alone and Jest would silently default to some value; in Jest 30, running that will prompt an error telling you to provide a number or percentage (e.g. `--maxWorkers=50%`). This prevents unintended behavior from typos or omissions in scripts. The upshot: double-check any CI or npm scripts using Jest flags to ensure they pass the required arguments.

### `--listTests` output to file

The `--listTests` flag can now be paired with an `--outputFile=<path>` option to write the list of test files to a file. This is helpful for scripting scenarios where you need to capture test file names.

### Better JSON output for errors

When using `jest --json` to get test results in JSON, error objects are now fully stringified. In Jest 30, your JSON reports will include complete error messages and stack traces (where previously some details were missing).

### Glob pattern matching updated

Jest uses glob patterns (via the `glob` package) for things like test file matching and module name mapping. In Jest 30, the underlying `glob` library has been upgraded to v10. Glob v10 brings some changes in syntax and stricter pattern interpretations. In most projects you won’t notice a difference, but if you have very custom glob patterns for `testMatch` or `moduleNameMapper`, be aware that a few edge cases might behave differently. If a pattern that used to match files suddenly doesn’t, you might need to tweak it slightly for the new `glob` engine. The majority of simple patterns are unaffected, and this update keeps Jest aligned with the latest pattern-matching behaviors.

### Opt-out of Jest’s Babel preset

If you use Babel to transform your code, Jest 30 introduces a new option in `babel-jest` called `excludeJestPreset`. Setting this in your Babel config will prevent Jest’s default Babel preset (`babel-preset-jest`) from being applied. This is useful for advanced setups where you want full control over Babel plugins/presets without Jest inserting its own preset behind the scenes.

### Flag for unhandled rejections

A new configuration flag `waitNextEventLoopTurnForUnhandledRejectionEvents` was added to fine-tune how Jest handles unhandled promise rejections. By enabling this flag, Jest will give one event-loop turn for a rejection to be handled before considering it truly unhandled. This can avoid false positives, especially in tests with lots of async code. Most users won’t need to change this setting, but it’s there if you encounter performance issues related to unhandled promise rejection detection.

### Programmatic CLI usage

For those embedding Jest into other tools or running it programmatically, the Jest CLI now exposes a `buildArgv` utility. This function helps you construct the argument object that Jest’s `run()` function expects, using the same defaults and normalization that the real CLI uses. In practical terms, if you’re invoking Jest from Node.js code, you can use `buildArgv()` to set up the CLI options easily instead of manually crafting the configuration.

### Test start timestamps in results

Each `TestCaseResultObject` within `onTestCaseResult` now includes a `startedAt` timestamp (in addition to the end time and duration). This detail is mainly useful for custom reporters or analyzing test performance.

### Terminal output compatibility

Jest’s default reporters now support an additional terminal control sequence (DEC mode 2026). This is a low-level improvement, but it ensures test results display correctly in terminals that use this mode.

There are also some smaller configuration improvements (for instance, Jest now surfaces the `rootDir` in error messages when a preset fails to load, which can help debug configuration issues), but the points above cover the most impactful changes and new options in the CLI and config.

## Performance Improvements

Beyond individual features, Jest 30 delivers real-world performance gains thanks to many internal optimizations. For example, one large TypeScript monolith (with a React client and a Node server, using PostgreSQL and Firebase emulators in its tests) observed significantly faster and leaner test runs after upgrading:

|                  | Jest 29             | Jest 30            |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Server tests** | ~1350s / 7.8 GB max | ~850s / 1.8 GB max |
| **Client tests** | ~49s / 1.0 GB max   | ~44s / 0.8 GB max  |

These improvements come from Jest 30’s work on memory leaks, module loading efficiency, and better ESM handling under the hood. While your mileage may vary, many projects – especially large ones – should see Jest 30 running tests a bit faster and using less memory than before.

### Globals cleanup between test files

Jest performs isolation between test files by running each in a separate [VM context](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm-executing-javascript), each with its own set of `global` variables.

In previous versions, Jest did not clean up these global variables after a test file finished running. Starting in Jest 30, most globals are now cleaned up after each file completes, significantly reducing memory leaks in long-running test suites.

To ensure a smooth transition, this change is introduced in a "soft" mode by default. In soft mode, globals aren't actually deleted, but accessing them after environment teardown triggers a deprecation warning (`JEST-01`).

You can opt into full cleanup with the following configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    globalsCleanupMode: 'hard',
  },
};
```

To disable the cleanup entirely, set the mode to `'off'`.

If you need to protect specific global objects from being cleaned up -- for example, shared utilities or caches -- you can mark them as protected using `jest-util`:

```ts
import { protectProperties } from 'jest-util';

protectProperties(globalThis['my-property']);
```

This prevents the cleanup system from deleting the referenced object's properties in hard mode.



## Breaking Changes and Migration Guide

As with any major release, some breaking changes come along with the new features. Jest 30 has removed certain deprecated APIs and made adjustments that may require updates in your tests or setup.

The Jest team has provided an **[official upgrade guide from v29 to v30](https://jestjs.io/docs/next/upgrading-to-jest30)** on the documentation site, which we highly recommend reading for a full breakdown. It contains detailed lists of breaking changes and instructions on how to update your code (with examples). In most cases, the fixes involve renaming options or updating function calls. Plan a bit of time to go through your tests and config after bumping to Jest 30, and you should be back to green tests in no time.

## Conclusion

Jest 30 is a significant release that modernizes the test framework and adds useful capabilities for developers. To recap, this version brings better support for ES modules and TypeScript out of the box, new options to control test retries and asynchronous setup, improved snapshot output (especially for React apps and error reporting), **and a variety of internal improvements that make Jest faster and more reliable**. While there are breaking changes to be aware of, most are cleanups of long-deprecated APIs or one-time config tweaks, and the migration path is well-documented in the official guide.

If you’re a Jest user, consider giving Jest 30 a try in your project. Update your Node version if needed, bump your TypeScript and dependencies, and follow the migration guide to address any renaming or removals. Once upgraded, you can enjoy the new features and enhancements knowing that Jest’s maintainers have worked hard to make this a smoother, more powerful testing experience.

Happy testing with Jest 30! 🎉
